## Free DirectShow Mpeg-4 Filters

The GDCL Mpeg-4 Demultiplexor and Multiplexor filters are now freely available for download in source form. You can re-use them in your projects, commercial or otherwise (provided that you don’t pretend that you wrote them) or use them as sample code when starting on your own project. Of course support and documentation are somewhat limited.

This initial release is being made available because of the insolvency of a customer. As I get time, I intend to enhance these filters. For now, they support ISO Mpeg-4 files containing Mpeg-4 and H.264 video and a variety of audio formats. The files created by the multiplexor will work with QuickTime and the iPod.

Note: both mux and demux filters need a small amount of code added for each media type that is to be supported. So far I have only added a limited set of types. If you need other types to be accepted, please get in touch directly. It’s likely that only a few lines of code will be needed.
